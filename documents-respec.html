<h2>Pre-standardization proposals</h2>

<p>The classes of specifications listed in this section have not received formal review by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties. These specifications are not approved by the W3C Director and do not imply endorsement by W3C Members.

<p>Specifications in this class MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards and MAY never become W3C standards.

<p>Software MAY implement these specifications at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on a specification.

  <section id='reports'>
  <h2>W3C Community Group Report or W3C Business Group Report</h2>

  <p>A W3C Community or Business Group Report is a document (specification or other type) produced by a W3C Community or Business Group. It may be in Draft or Final form. When such a group announces a Final Report that is a Specification, the group asks participants to make patent licensing commitments for their contributions under the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.
   Group reports follow the W3C Community and Business Group Process, designed to allow an easy way for innovation by individuals, outside the formal W3C standards process.
  <p>A W3C Community or Business Group report MAY get picked up by a standards organization, including W3C, to incorporate into a future Standard.
  </section>
  <section id='submission'>
  <h2>W3C Member Submission</h2>

  <p>A W3C Member Submission is a document allowing W3C Members to propose technology or other ideas for consideration.
  <p>The Member Submission process affords W3C Members a record of their contribution and gives them a mechanism for disclosures (including IPR claims).
  <p>A Member Submission MAY get picked up by a standards organization, including W3C, to incorporate into a future Standard.
  </section>
  <section id='eddraft-note'>
    <h2>Editor's draft (intended to become a Note)</h2>

<section id=notes>
  <h2>W3C Note track</h2>

  <p>The classes of specifications listed in this section have received different levels of review by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties according to W3C Process. Some are intended to eventually receive endorsement by the W3C Director and W3C Members.

  <p>Software MAY implement these specifications at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on a specification.

  <p>Specifications in this class MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards and MAY never become W3C standards, with the exception of W3C Statements.

  <p>The classes of specifications listed in this section do not have patent licensing commitments.

  <p>A Group Note is published by a chartered W3C Working Group, W3C Interest Group, the Technical Architecture Group (TAG), or the Advisory Board (AB).

      <h2>Draft Registry</h2>

      <p>Some Registries are developed through successive Draft Registries, with an expectation that they will become Registries, and possibly Statements.Some W3C Notes are intended to contain a registry and to be normatively referenced by one or more Standards. Each such specification SHOULD document its own process for future updates.
        </section>
        <section id='registry'>
          <h2>Registry</h2>

          <p>The purpose of a Registry specification can include
