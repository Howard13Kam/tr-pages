# ClearSpec 2021  (send comments to plh@w3.org)

Provide clarity in W3C products
 
 Note: there is an overarching issue created for this project at
 https://github.com/w3c/tr-pages/issues/90

# Goals

1. Help the public to differentiate among documents produced by W3C Groups (W/I/B/C).
1. Establish W3C Recommendations as the sole W3C Web standards (in comparison to other types of W3C documents)
1. document and inform about the level of adoption of various documents, including our standards.

# Audience

1. devrel advocates
1. web developers
1. implementers
1. general public

# What use cases are we trying to solve?

1. Talking to the public about the document: "Time to experiment", "Time to comment", "Time to adopt", "mature", "new", "done, "not done"
1. Spec editors creating references to W3C documents (stable, point in the general direction, etc.)
1. Product manager use case: what to use?
1. Users / developers who ask browser vendor "why aren't you implementing this technology?"

(Projects below are ordered by priority)

# Project #1

Reestablish the expectations for Community Group documents and how we apply/enforce them
Address CG reports and ongoing proposals

1. Revisit CG sample as needed
  1. https://www.w3.org/community/src/css/spec/sample
  1. https://www.w3.org/community/reports/reqs/
     e.g. s/Draft Report/Proposal/ ? (RRS: maybe not all "reports" are envisioned to become "proposals".)
     s/Proposal/Incubation/
     Note: we'll need a proper design lead.
  1. Revive and improve CG reports listings
     we have some of that information
     we need a clear value to motivate the CGs.
     current system is obsolete
  1. Consider establishing proposals.w3.org
     maybe aligned with https://pad.w3.org/p/group-editors-draft
     e.g. https://proposals.w3.org/wicg/background-fetch
     [RRS: would this differ from drafts.w3.org proxy for github.io/w3c/  (project 4)?  If so, how?]
  1. Run checks in background on CG reports/proposals
     a limited pubrules only intended to alert devrel on misbehaviors
  1. Provide a reporting system to the community to report confusion  


We'll start with WICG to refine the proposal before circulating with spec-prod and CG chairs

https://wicg.github.io/tracking.html

We need 2 months to refine the proposal and one month to deploy

Note: #3 cannot be implemented in April/May
 
ETA:
 1, 2, 4, 5 can be done within 3 months
 3 can be done in June/July (needs Jean-Gui/Denis)

 (interested: Judy, Ralph, Dom?)
